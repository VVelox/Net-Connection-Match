                         local_host=>'10.0.0.2',
                         local_port=>'12322',
                         proto=>'tcp4',
                         state=>'ESTABLISHED',

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This intiates the object.

The key in the hash ref commands is a array
that holds regular expressions to match against
the wait channel.

If the new method fails, it dies.

    my %args=(
              wchans=>[
                      'kernel',
                      ],
              );
    
    my $checker=Net::Connection::Match::WChan->new( \%args );

=cut

sub new{
	my %args;
	if(defined($_[1])){
		%args= %{$_[1]};
	};

	# run some basic checks to make sure we have the minimum stuff required to work
	if ( ! defined( $args{wchans} ) ){
		die ('No wchans key specified in the argument hash');
	}
	if ( ref( \$args{wchans} ) eq 'ARRAY' ){
		die ('The wchans key is not a array');
	}
	if ( ! defined $args{wchans}[0] ){
		die ('Nothing defined in the commands array');
	}

    my $self = {
				wchans=>$args{wchans},
				};
    bless $self;

	return $self;
}

=head2 match

Checks if a single Net::Connection object matches the stack.

One argument is taken and that is a Net::Connection object.

The returned value is a boolean.

    if ( $checker->match( $conn ) ){
        print "The connection matches.\n";
    }

=cut

sub match{
	my $self=$_[0];
	my $object=$_[1];

	if ( !defined( $object ) ){
		return 0;
	}

	if ( ref( $object ) ne 'Net::Connection' ){
		return 0;
	}

	my $conn_pid=$object->pid;

	# don't bother proceeding, the object won't match ever
	# as it does not have a PID
	if ( ! defined( $conn_pid ) ){
		return 0;
	}


	my $loop=0;
	my $wchan;
	if ( ! defined( $object->proc ) ){
		# go through each proc and look for a matching pid
		my $proctable=Proc::ProcessTable->new;
		my $procs=$proctable->table;
		my $proc_int=0;
		my $loop=1;
		while (
			   $loop &&
			   defined( $procs->[$proc_int] )
			   ){

			if ( $conn_pid eq $procs->[$proc_int]->{pid} ){
				$wchan=$procs->[$proc_int]->wchan;

				# exit the loop as we found it
				$loop=0;
			}

		$proc_int++;
		}
	}else{
		$wchan=$object->wchan;
	}

	# likely a dead connection that is handing around...
	# or disappeared since grabbing the connection list
	# and starting processing
	if ( !defined( $wchan ) ){
		return 0;
	}

	# check each command regex and see if any of them match
	foreach my $regex ( @{ $self->{wchans} } ){
		if ( $wchan =~ /$regex/ ){
			return 1;
		}
	}

	return 0;
