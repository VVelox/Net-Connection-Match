=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This intiates the object.

It takes a hash reference with one key. One key is required and
that is 'usernames', which is a array of usernames to match.

Atleast one protocol must be present.

If the new method fails, it dies.

    my %args=(
              usernames=>[
                          'root',
                          'slapd',
                         ],
              );
    
    my $checker=Net::Connection::Match::Username->new( \%args );

=cut

sub new{
	my %args;
	if(defined($_[1])){
		%args= %{$_[1]};
	};

	# run some basic checks to make sure we have the minimum stuff required to work
	if ( ! defined( $args{usernames} ) ){
		die ('No usernames key specified in the argument hash');
	}
	if ( ref( \$args{usernames} ) eq 'ARRAY' ){
		die ('The usernames key is not a array');
	}
	if ( ! defined $args{usernames}[0] ){
		die ('No states defined in the protos array');
	}

    my $self = {
				usernames=>$args{usernames},
				};
    bless $self;

	return $self;
}

=head2 match

Checks if a single Net::Connection object matches the stack.

One argument is taken and that is a Net::Connection object.

The returned value is a boolean.

    if ( $checker->match( $conn ) ){
        print "The connection matches.\n";
    }

=cut

sub match{
	my $self=$_[0];
	my $object=$_[1];

	if ( !defined( $object ) ){
		return 0;
	}

	if ( ref( $object ) ne 'Net::Connection' ){
		return 0;
	}

	# does not have a user.... we won't match
	if ( ! defined( $object->username ) ){
		return 0;
	}

	# check for matches
	foreach my $username ( @{ $self->{usernames} } ){
		if ( $username eq $object->username ){
			return 1;
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
