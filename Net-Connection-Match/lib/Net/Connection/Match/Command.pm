=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Connection::Match::Command;
    use Net::Connection;
    
    my $connection_args={
                         foreign_host=>'10.0.0.1',
                         foreign_port=>'22',
                         local_host=>'10.0.0.2',
                         local_port=>'12322',
                         proto=>'tcp4',
                         state=>'ESTABLISHED',
                         pid=>0,
                        };
    
    my $conn=Net::Connection->new( $connection_args );

                         'kernel',
                         ],

    }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This intiates the object.

The key in the hash ref commands is a array
that holds regular expressions to match against
the command line or fname(in case of blank command
line). At least one value must be defined.

If the new method fails, it dies.

    my %args=(
              commands=>[
                         'kernel',
                         ],
              );
    
    my $checker=Net::Connection::Match::Command->new( \%args );

=cut

sub new{
	my %args;
	if(defined($_[1])){
		%args= %{$_[1]};
	};

	# run some basic checks to make sure we have the minimum stuff required to work
	if ( ! defined( $args{commands} ) ){
		die ('No commands key specified in the argument hash');
	}
	if ( ref( \$args{commands} ) eq 'ARRAY' ){
		die ('The commands key is not a array');
	}
	if ( ! defined $args{commands}[0] ){
		die ('Nothing defined in the commands array');
	}

    my $self = {
				commands=>$args{commands},
				};
    bless $self;

	return $self;
}

=head2 match

Checks if a single Net::Connection object matches the stack.

One argument is taken and that is a Net::Connection object.

The returned value is a boolean.

    if ( $checker->match( $conn ) ){
        print "The connection matches.\n";
    }

=cut

sub match{
	my $self=$_[0];
	my $object=$_[1];

	if ( !defined( $object ) ){
		return 0;
	}

	if ( ref( $object ) ne 'Net::Connection' ){
		return 0;
	}

	my $conn_pid=$object->pid;

	# don't bother proceeding, the object won't match ever
	# as it does not have a PID
	if ( ! defined( $conn_pid ) ){
		return 0;
	}

	# go through each proc and look for a matching pid
	my $proctable=Proc::ProcessTable->new;
	my @procs=$proctable->table;
	my $loop=1;
	my $proc_int=0;
	my $command;
	while (
		   $loop &&
		   defined( $procs[$proc_int] )
		   ){
		if ( $conn_pid eq $procs[$proc_int]->pid ){
			my $command=$procs[$proc_int]->cmndline;
			# '' means it is a kernel process
			if ( $command =~ /^$/ ){
				$command='['.$procs[$proc_int]->fname.']';
			}
			# exit the loop as we found it
			$loop=0;
		}

		$proc_int++;
	}

	# likely a dead connection that is handing around...
	# or disappeared since grabbing the connection list
	# and starting processing
	if ( !defined( $command ) ){
		return 0;
	}

	# check each command regex and see if any of them match
	foreach my $regex ( @{ $self->{commands} } ){
		if ( $command =~ /$regex/ ){
			return 1;
		}
	}

	return 0;
